this repository aims to make a compiler for brainf#ck language that takes the string as a params and generates a .asm file
that one can use an assembler and linker to get an executable
this is not an advanced project as brainf#ck is an estoteric language all characters are directly mapable as a two register or three
register instruction no ast building or actual steps of a compiler are present this is more of a fun project
